# MindScribe: A Secure Journaling API

**MindScribe** is a robust and secure backend service for a journaling application, built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. It provides a complete set of RESTful APIs for user management and CRUD operations on journal entries, secured with modern authentication practices.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Secure User Authentication:** Implemented a robust authentication and authorization system using Spring Security and a custom UserDetailsService.
*   **User Management:** Endpoints for user registration and login.
*   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for journal entries.
*   **RESTful API Design:** A well-structured API for easy integration with any frontend.
*   **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific configurations using Spring Profiles (`dev` and `prod`).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build and testing pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
*   **Security:** Spring Security, JWT
*   **Database:** Spring Data, MongoDB
*   **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
*   **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito
*   **Code Quality:** SonarQube (for static analysis), JaCoCo (for coverage)
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java JDK 17 or later
*   Apache Maven
*   A running instance of MongoDB

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LoopMaster99/MindScribe
    cd MindScribe
    ```

2.  **Configure the application:**
    Open `src/main/resources/application-dev.yml` and update the MongoDB connection details.
    ```yaml
    spring:
      data:
        mongodb:
          uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/journal_db

    ```

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`. Use the `dev` profile to connect to your local database.
    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
    ```

## üß™ Testing & Code Quality

This project uses JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing and JaCoCo for measuring code coverage.

1.  **Run the test suite:**
    ```sh
    mvn test
    ```

2.  **View Coverage Report:**
    After running the tests, the code coverage report can be found in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`. Your project also includes a pre-generated report in the `htmlReport/` directory.

## üìÑ API Endpoints

The API is structured into public, user-specific, journal, and admin routes. Access to user and journal routes requires authentication.
